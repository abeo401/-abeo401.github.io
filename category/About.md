Prof. <strong> Lee Byung-ryong, </strong> a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Ulsan,
has secured 3D measurement technology by conducting research on 3D measurement that
can measure weld defects using laser and machine vision. Based on this technology, we
started to develop 3D scanners.
 In 2014, we developed a prototype of a structured light type 3D scanner with measurement
accuracy of 0.02mm using a beam projector and a CCD camera.  Then, professor Lee
Byung-Ryong and Dr. Do Van Phu jointly founded Abeosystem Co., LTD.
